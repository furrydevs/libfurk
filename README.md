# libFurk

Library to interact with Furcadia.

Note: This code is in very early development and not usable for anything right now!

## Roadmap

- Simple API to interact with Furcadia
- Convince methods for various interactions
- Native library and other artifacts that can be included in other projects (WASM, etc.)
